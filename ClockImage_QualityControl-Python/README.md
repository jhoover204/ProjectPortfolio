# Description

The following project was an individual assignment for a python programming course at the University of Edinburgh. The overall goal is to create well-documented code and functions to perform a quality control of clock-face images (RGB images) to identify which clocks (out of a batch set) were aligned to the correct time (hour and hand minute match correctly). 

The project is segmented into 7 separate questions breaking the problem down into smaller subsections. The tasks are defined within the notebook `project_1.ipynb` included in this repo.

We were provided the testing images and graphics. My output is the QC_report folder which contains a QC report (.txt file) for each batch telling which clocks need to be send back for readjustment (and by how many minutes).
