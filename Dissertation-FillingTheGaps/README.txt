Dissertation 2: Reconstructing Sentinel-2 Optical Data from Sentinel-1 SAR Data Using a Machine Learning Approach

Author: Jonathan Hoover

This folder contains three subfolders: Dissertation_PDF, Poster_PDF, and Code

Dissertation_PDF and Poster_PDF are just folders containing the final PDFs of my dissertation and poster

Code contains:

(Please note that all .ipynb files were originally written in google collab)

A) JRH_Filling_the_Gaps_Image_Generation2.ipynb: This is a jupyter notebook containing the code used to process images and generate the model
							       training and testing sets. It can be run in collab.

B) Exploration_Models_Analysis.ipynb: This is a jupyter notebook containing the code required for exploratory analysis, model building,
						  and analysis. The model sections are set to only run if specified since they take a while to train. 
				              The rest can be run in collab. 

C) JRH_Build_Nerual_Train_Sets: This is a jupyter notebook containing the code required to generate the neural network
					 training and test sets. The neural network is only in the supplement for the dissertation.
					 This can be run in collab.

D) Filling_the_GAPS_S_CycleGAN_Attempt: This a jupyter notebook containing the code for running the attempted neural network.
						    It is only in the supplement. Note that this requires a GPU, so it must be run in collab.
