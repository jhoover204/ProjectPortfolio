   abstract = {<p>Sex differences in late-life memory decline may be explained by sex differences in dementia risk factors. Episodic memory and dementia risk factors were assessed in young, middle-aged and older adults over 12 years in a population-based sample (N = 7485). For men in midlife and old age, physical, cognitive and social activities were associated with less memory decline, and financial hardship was associated with more. <italic>APOE e4</italic> and vascular risk factors were associated with memory decline for women in midlife. Depression, cognitive and physical activity were associated with memory change in older women. Incident midlife hypertension (β = − 0.48, 95% CI − 0.87, − 0.09, p = 0.02) was associated with greater memory decline in women and incident late-life stroke accounted for greater memory decline in men (β = − 0.56, 95% CI − 1.12, − 0.01), p = 0.05). Women have fewer modifiable risk factors than men. Stroke and hypertension explained sex differences in memory decline for men and women respectively. </p>},
